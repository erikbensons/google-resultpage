Google Resultpage

The resultpage is a little bit trickier since it has so many more components than the search page. I think the hardest part might be to add the videos, the dropdown menu with the FAQ and the web design programs, aka the more visually styled sections of the page. Let's break down the components of the page:

1. Header with Google logo, search bar, the profile picture and the app selection.
2. A sub-heading which is not fixed to the top of the website. This includes the different tabs, but only the all tab needs to function.
3. The main body of the website.
    1. Number of search results
    2. Search results
    3. Videos
    4. People also ask
    5. People also search for
    6. Searches related to build this webpage
    7. Google pages
4. Footer with location and options.
